Notary
======
Notary is the most basic/boneheaded/fast-loading notetaking app possible.

This is a practice in extreme perceived performance: when you launch it, it gives you your note history and a soft keyboard to append a note at the end, thats it, just type and you're done. It loads 20 lines of your notes from Preferences then loads in the rest of your notes from the background from a file and prepends them.

It then guarantees persistence of them. Yes, the entire thing is kept in memory, but its just text, right?

I also added some sexy customizations to scrolling so that if you start scrolling, it hides the keyboard to increase viewport size.
